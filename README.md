# Principles of Data Analytics

This repository contains my work for the Principles of Data Analytics module, part of the Science in Computing (Data Analytics) course at Atlantic Technological University (ATU). It includes weekly programming tasks, assignments, and data analysis exercises.

## About This Repository 
 
Each week, we complete a task that applies key data analytics concepts, such as handling datasets, performing calculations, and visualizing data using Python. The tasks follow the outline provided by our lecturer, available [here](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/principles_of_data_analytics/blob/main/assessment/tasks.md).  

## Tools & Libraries Used  

To complete these tasks, I use the following tools and libraries:  

- **Python**: The programming language used for all tasks. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A web-based environment for running Python code. Learn more [here](https://jupyter.org/).  
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis. Documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).  
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing. Documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/).  
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html).  
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that includes the Iris dataset used in some tasks. Documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).  

## How to Run the Code  

To set up your environment and run the code in this repository, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elainecazetta/principles_of_data_analytics.git
   cd principles_of_data_analytics
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
   ```  
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  
4. **Open and run the weekly tasks**  
   - Navigate to the `.ipynb` files and run them in Jupyter Notebook.  

## Weekly Task Examples  
- **Week 1**: Loading and analyzing the Iris dataset using Pandas.  
- **Week 2**: Reading and analyzing files using Python.  
- **Week 4**: Generating histograms using Matplotlib.
